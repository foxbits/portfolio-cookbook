## Tech Stack

The contents of the website is built with [React](https://react.dev) ([Next.JS](https://nextjs.org)) and some custom libraries on top of it. The standard react workflows and commands are available for it.

The application is deployed with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). It is integrated with an automated CI/CD on a private [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) Server, which connects it through [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) to the publicly hosted website.

## Documentation

### Application structure

Standard next.js app router based structure, with some important mentions:

- [`src/app/data/portfolio.ts`](src/app/data/portfolio.ts) - static data source (with comments) which is used to store CV data, which is then rendered with React in the different sections
- [`public/js`](public/js), [`public/css`](public/css) - custom preloaded scripts and CSS that are not integrated with React, loaded in the [`src/app/app-client-layout.tsx`](src/app/app-client-layout.tsx) and in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx)
- [`public/img`](public/img) - images, logos, some of them with dual versions - one small (thumbnail), other large which is lazyloaded
- [`public/files`](public/files) - can contain any file, recommended to keep other versions of the CV, like EUROPASS PDF, then linked in the Profile section
- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile), [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) - scripts to build the docker image, deploy it with compose (linked to custom [`build-docker.sh`](build-docker.sh) and [`docker-compose.run.sh`](docker-compose.run.sh))
- [`Jenkinsfile`](Jenkinsfile) - script that runs on jenkins, which uses a SSH agent that connects to docker (DooS) and is able to run the application (only does so from master)

### Customization
You can reorder sections as you wish in the [`page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx).

All the data that is shown on page is defined inside [`src/app/data/portfolio.ts`](src/app/data/portfolio.ts), which has comments on how to use it or customise it.

### Caveats

This website has been migrated from a singular, plain HTML+JS+CSS version. Some of the scripts used in the initial version are not migrated yet, and are loaded and executed async in the application's main page. There is a plan to migrate it, but it will be completed when the time is right.
